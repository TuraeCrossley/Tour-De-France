# Tour-De-France
This project aims to analyze the historical data from the early years of the Tour de France, one of the most prestigious cycling races in the world. I will explore trends and patterns in the data, focusing on the years 1903 to 2022.

The dataset includes the following fields:

Year: The year of the race
Dates: The dates of the race
Stages: The number of stages in the race
Distance: The total distance of the race in kilometers and miles
Starters: The number of cyclists that started the race
Finishers: The number of cyclists that finished the race

We will examine how the number of stages, total distance, and the number of participants have changed over time. This will involve creating line graphs to visualize these trends.

We will calculate the completion rate for each year (the number of finishers divided by the number of starters) and analyze how this rate has changed over time. This will give us insights into the race's difficulty across different years.

We will investigate if there's a correlation between the number of stages, total distance, and the completion rate. This will involve calculating correlation coefficients and possibly creating scatter plots.

Tools Used:
This project will use Python for data analysis, with libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
